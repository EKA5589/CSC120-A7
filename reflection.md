- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance definitely speeds up coding. You start with a base which you can just extend off of to make your life easier. 

I would say that most things worked. I still struggle with knowing how to debug my code but for the most part inheritance was fairly easy to understand. For someone taking the course in the future, I would say to leave more time to complete the assignment.
